This supports the sufficiency of linear methods for tasks such as classifying different jets, and indeed we find that a linear classifier using EFPs performs surprisingly well on a variety of jet discrimination tasks.","tags":null,"title":"Energy Flow Polynomials: A complete linear basis for jet substructure","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513036800,"objectID":"3f0e0e53e6d4972dc02fc1bbd76a6671","permalink":"https://pkomiske.com/talk/ml4jets2017/","publishdate":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ml4jets2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Linear Jet Tagging with the Energy Flow Basis","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504828800,"objectID":"556c6423fe1b48f6288835fa564374a6","permalink":"https://pkomiske.com/talk/ctpjournal2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ctpjournal2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quark/Gluon Discrimination with Jet-Images and Deep Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Patrick T.
